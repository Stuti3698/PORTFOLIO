During my internship at CodeClause as a web development intern, I created a fundamental online resume that provides comprehensive information 
about myself, including details about my skills and showcased projects.

In this GitHub repository, you will find the code and files for the online resume I developed during my internship at CodeClause.
This web-based resume serves as a digital representation of my professional profile, offering insights into my skills, qualifications,
and featured projects. The repository includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code used to build the resume, making it a valuable resource for anyone 
interested in web development or seeking inspiration for their own online portfolio.

Feel free to explore the code, customize it to your preferences, or use it as a reference for your web development projects. 
If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your input is highly appreciated, and I hope this project
proves useful to you in your web development endeavors.
